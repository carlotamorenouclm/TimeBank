# ⏳ TimeBankBack

Backend of the **Time Bank** web application developed for the Web Systems Development laboratory assignment.

## 📌 Project Overview

Time Bank is a peer-to-peer platform where users exchange services using a virtual currency called **Time Credits**.
Users can offer services, request services, and manage their balance within the system.

The application follows a RESTful architecture with token-based authentication (JWT).

## 🏗 Repositories Structure

The project is divided into two independent repositories:

* **TimeBankBack** → Main backend (Django + REST API)
* **TimeBankFront** → Frontend application (client-side interface)

The backend manages:

* User authentication and authorization
* Roles (Administrator / User)
* Services, requests, and transactions (implemented across sprints)
* Time credits logic

The frontend consumes the backend API.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* Python
* Django
